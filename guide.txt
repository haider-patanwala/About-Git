~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~STEP 0.1 ( 1st time setup)(did to let people know that these things are done by me and my email)
Meet@LAPTOP-96UORJI6 MINGW64 ~/My VScode/Web_Dev/75-79_88_Dance_Website
$ git config --global user.name Meet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~git g~~~~~STEP 0.2
Meet@LAPTOP-96UORJI6 MINGW64 ~/My VScode/Web_Dev/75-79_88_Dance_Website
$git config --global user.email "meetmakwana20.@gmail.com"

~~~~~~~~~~~To know it is set up or not
Meet@LAPTOP-96UORJI6 MINGW64 ~
$ git config --global user.name
Meet

Meet@LAPTOP-96UORJI6 MINGW64 ~
$ git config --global user.email
meetmakwana20.@gmail.com

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~STEP 1 

$touch .gitignore
-----------------"touch" creates a new blank file  of .gitignore

edit the .gitignore file and add the name of the folder which we dont want to upload 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~STEP 2
> FYI : If we want to get a repo then 2 options,
	1. git init(it initializes from start)
	OR
	2. clone (it clones a repo we want and clones it's whole data from server)

$git init

(will create a .git file, keep hidden files enable to see it)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~STEP 3
> Very imp Flow of git - 

	    Untracked file(On local device)----> Staged(filewhich we wish to put on git) <---|
						    |					     |
						    |	{ Commit }			     |
						    v					     |
					Unmodified file on git				     |
			(Goes on git which we can edit/remove)[snapshot taken by git]	     |
						    |					     |
						    |  (If edited)			     |
						    v					     |
				          Modified file on git >------(Back to staging)------|

$ git add .
(to put all the contents at staging area, . means all)

OR
$ git add `filename`
( if dont want to put all files then use syntax " git add `filename` ")

OR
$ git add -A
( if want to put all the files at staging then "git add -A"

*can check status now by 
$ git status

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~STEP 4

--------git commit means taking a snapshot 
----------so git add and git commit makes a snapshot associated to the changes we made
----------but right now nothing is added to my repo so using "Initial commit"

$ git commit ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~> if this command is executed then an editor will open then press "i" to edit and write the message "Initial commit" and then press "Esc" key and then type ":wq" to save and exit the file

-------ALTERNATE EASY METHOD --------------
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"

-------I prefer :
$ git commit -a -m "msg"
(skips staging and directly commits)

*********************************************Commit done, now Push remaining********************************************

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~STEP 4

To finally push the "master" branch on "origin" url 

$ git push -u origin master

(If once push -u origin is used then next time we just write "git push" which will by default push it the branch which was last commanded with "-u")

-----------------------------------
*TO RESTORE FILES FROM LAST COMMIT
USED TO GET BACK THE LAST VERSION OF THE FILE IF SOMEONE HAS WRONGLY EDITED AND SAVED IT.
ESSENTIALLY MATCHING WITH THE LAST COMMIT !!
$ git checkout `filename`

TO MATCH ALL THE FILES WITH LAST COMMIT AND CHANGE AND THEM ACCORDING TO THE LAST COMMIT !!
$ git checkout -f

-----------------------------------
*LOGS
TO GET LOG OF ALL OUR COMMITS
$ git log

TO FILTER OUT LOGS OF COMMITS
(FOR EG. TO GET LAST 2 COMMITS, it also shows the changes)
$ git log -p -2
(press "q" to exit)

-----------------------------------
*COMPARISON
WILL COMPARE AND SHOW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CURRENT FILES(WORKING TREE) AND STAGED FILES
$ git diff

WILL COMPARE AND SHOW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LAST COMMIT AND STAGED FILES
$ git diff --staged

------------------------------------
TO DIRECTLY COMMIT BY SKIPPING STAGING AREA
$ git commit -a -m "Skipped staging area and commited directly"

------------------------------------
WILL REMOVE THE FILE FROM LOCAL STORAGE & STAGING AREA
$ git rm `filename`

WILL REMOVE THE FILE FROM STAGING AREA ONLY, LOCAL ONE WILL REMAIN THE SAME
$ git rm --cached `filename`

------------------------------------
SHORTHAND FOR STATUS
$ git status -s
MM  about.html(this will be in green meaning modified in staging area)(2nd M will be in red meaning modified in working tree)
 M site.html (this will be in red meaning modified in working tree )
?? waste.html

------------------------------------
.gitignore file ignores all the files which are even in the the folders

SHOULD BE KNOWN : 
1. TO IGNORE ALL THE FILE-TYPES(.log) ADD THIS IS IN .gitignore
   eg: (.log)
   *.log

2. TO IGNORE A FOLDER USE A FORWAD SLASH
   `folder_name`/

Just commited,
    $ git commit -a -m "Ignored some files nd added gitignore"

------------------------------------
BRANCH = Used to make a copy to work on differently

BY DEFAULT, IT IS BRANCH "MASTER".

TO CREATE A BRANCH
$ git branch `name_of_branch`

TO KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL BRANCHES:
$ git branch

SHORTHAND FOR CREATING AND ENTERING(SWITCHING TO IT) THE BRANCH AT THE SAME TIME
$ git checkout -b newBranch

TO SWITCH TO ANOTHER BRANCH
Meet@LAPTOP-96UORJI6 MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/New folder (master)
$ git checkout feature1

Switched to branch 'feature1'

Meet@LAPTOP-96UORJI6 MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/New folder (feature1)
$ git status

On branch feature1
nothing to commit, working tree clean

**Keep the file open and see the changes when switching between branches.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				GITHUB
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make a repo on github with no files(no readme, etc)

ON GIT BASH : TO CONNECT TO GITHUB'S REMOTE REPO WITH OUR LOCAL REPO
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:meetmakwana19/about-git.git
MEANING A REMOTE NAMED "origin" IS ADDED AND OUR URL CAN BE CALLED AS "origin"

TO SEE REMOTE
$ git remote
OUTPUT:
origin

TO SEE URL 
$git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:meetmakwana19/about-git.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:meetmakwana19/about-git.git (push)

------------------------------------
NOW GITHUB IS NNOT LINKED WITH OUR PC 
SO TO PUSH THE REPPO TO GITHUB DO THE FOLLOWING 

1. Go to https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?utm_source=Blog to generate new ssh key.

2. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.
   $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

3. To generate Agent pid
   $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

4. To read the ssh key I went to the directory given by preious eval command and opened .pub file with notepad

5. Copied the ssh key and added it as a new ssh key on Github's 
   Acc settings > SSH Keys > New SSH Key(green button)

6. Went to repo's "Code" tab and clicked on "Code v" green button and copied ssh  url 

7. Copied the SSH url git@github.com:meetmakwana19/about-git.git

8. $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:meetmakwana19/about-git.git

9. To finally push the "master" branch on "origin" url 

   $ git push -u origin master

   (If once push -u origin is used then next time we just write "git push" which will by default push it the branch which was last commanded with "-u")

**************To push another branches on GitHub too,
1. $ git checkout newBranch

2. $ git push -u origin 

------------------------------------
CLONE COMMAND

1. Making a new folder and opening git bash over there to clone into that folder.

2. Will go to any public repo on Github and under code tab will copy the https link.

3. In that folder's git bash will write 

   $ git clone https://github.com/meetmakwana19/To-Do-List.git meet
   where https is the link of repo to be cloned and "meet" is the folder name where the repo to be closed inside our opened folder.

   $ git clone https://github.com/meetmakwana19/To-Do-List.git
   *If "meet" folder name not given then a folder of repo's name will be created.
